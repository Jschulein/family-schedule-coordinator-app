## Integration Testing

- [ ] Authentication + Family creation flow
- [ ] Family creation + Event sharing

## Testing Notes

For each test, document:
1. Expected behavior
2. Actual behavior
3. Error messages (if any)
4. Browser console logs
5. Screenshots or videos where helpful
6. Environment details (browser, device, etc.)

Use this test plan to systematically verify functionality and identify issues that need to be fixed. Update the ERROR_LOG.md document with any issues found during testing.
