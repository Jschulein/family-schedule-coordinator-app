# Application Test Plan

This document outlines a systematic approach to testing the application's functionality to identify and resolve issues.

## Authentication Testing

- [ ] View upcoming events
- [ ] Filter events by date range
- [ ] Edit existing events
  - [ ] Navigate to edit page
  - [ ] Load event data properly
  - [ ] Update event details

- [ ] Select specific dates
- [ ] View events for selected date
- [ ] Proper handling of multi-day events
- [ ] Color coding by family or event type
- [ ] Responsive layout on different screen sizes

## Navigation Testing

- [ ] All links direct to correct routes
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation works properly
- [ ] Deep linking to specific pages works
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] 404 page for invalid routes

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Initial load time
- [ ] Calendar render performance with many events
- [ ] Form submission response times
- [ ] Data fetching efficiency
- [ ] Memory usage over time

## Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Form validation errors
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Authentication error handling
- [ ] Permission error handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation of features

## Mobile Responsiveness Testing

- [ ] Test on small screens (mobile)
- [ ] Test on medium screens (tablet)
- [ ] Test on large screens (desktop)
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly
- [ ] Form inputs are accessible on mobile

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast compliance
- [ ] Text scaling
- [ ] Focus management

## Integration Testing

- [ ] Authentication + Family creation flow
- [ ] Family creation + Event sharing
- [ ] Calendar view + Event editing
- [ ] Notifications + Event actions

## Detailed Testing Procedures

### Edit Event Testing

1. **Preparation:**
   - Create a test event or find an existing one
   - Note the event ID for direct navigation testing

2. **Basic Navigation Tests:**
   - Navigate to the edit page from the calendar view
   - Navigate directly to the edit page using the event ID in the URL
   - Test browser back button functionality
   - Test cancel button functionality

3. **Data Loading Tests:**
   - Verify event data loads correctly from context
   - Verify event data loads correctly when accessed directly (not from context)
   - Test with non-existent event IDs
   - Test with invalid event IDs

4. **Form Functionality Tests:**
   - Verify all form fields populate with correct event data
   - Change individual fields and submit
   - Test date and time pickers
   - Test family member selection

5. **Validation Tests:**
   - Submit with required fields empty
   - Test date validation (past dates, end before start)
   - Test with very long text inputs

6. **Update Process Tests:**
   - Complete a valid update and verify database changes
   - Verify proper redirection after update
   - Verify toast notifications on success/failure

7. **Delete Process Tests:**
   - Open delete dialog
   - Cancel deletion
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify database changes and redirects

8. **Error Handling Tests:**
   - Test with network disconnected
   - Test with insufficient permissions
   - Test with conflicting updates

## Testing Notes

For each test, document:
1. Expected behavior
2. Actual behavior
3. Error messages (if any)
4. Browser console logs
5. Screenshots or videos where helpful
6. Environment details (browser, device, etc.)

Use this test plan to systematically verify functionality and identify issues that need to be fixed. Update the ERROR_LOG.md document with any issues found during testing.
